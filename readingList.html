												<p class="book1-text"><strong>Currently</strong> reading  
													The Kite Runner, the tale of a young boy growing up in Afghanistan, navigating friendship, betrayal, and redemption amidst the backdrop of his country's tumultuous history. It's a gripping narrative that explores themes of guilt, loyalty, and the enduring bonds of childhood.
													<br>
													<br>I orignally read this 10+ years ago, it's such a good book especially if you're into drama, coming-of-age, and cultural exploration novels. 
													If you like Old Yeller or Where the Red Fern Grows, you'll love this!</p>
											</section>

											<section class="book2-border book-box">
												<p class="book2-text"> A New Earth changed my life, this is definately a <strong>favorite</strong>! This book started me on my spiritual journey, along with meditation. It challenges you to explore your ego and self identification. Shines a light into the shadows of how our mind uses us vs us using our mind.  
												
												<br>
												<br>It's important to me to always be evolving and growing.
													If you feel the same, or if you enjoy Brene Brown or Esther Perel's work, I'd recommend giving this a try.</p>

												<img  class="breath" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71eMqYfx9zL._SL1500_.jpg" alt="Breath" />
										
												<p class="book1-text"><strong>Currently</strong> listening on Audible. Breath delves into the ancient practice of breathing through a modern scientific lens, exploring its profound impact on our health & well-being. This insightful book uncovers the transformative power of breath, offering actionable and practical techniques to optimize breathing for improved physical and mental health. 
													<br>
													<br>
												While participating in a vipassana, our teacher phrased our breath in a way that really stuck with me. Our breathing is the gate way to connecting to our inner physical body. If you enjoy books that break down spiritual practices in a scientific and tanglable way, check out this book.
												</p>
												
											</section>

											<section class="book4-border book-box">
												<p class="book2-text">In <strong>queue</strong>: Quiet is an exploration into the power of introversion in a world that often celebrates extroversion. The book sheds light on the strengths and talents of introverts, challenging common misconceptions and providing valuable insights into how introverts can thrive in various aspects of life.
													<br>
													<br>
													Are you also an introvert? Curious to hear your thoughts if you've read this already!

												<img class="bittersweet" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81GZ-KIz5yL._SL1500_.jpg" alt="">
												<p class="book1-text">In <strong>queue</strong>: Bittersweet is a captivating tale that follows the lives of individuals navigating love, ambition, and the complexities of family dynamics. Set against a backdrop of intricate relationships and personal growth, the story offers a poignant exploration of the highs and lows of life, blending moments of sweetness with the bitterness of reality.
													<br>
													<br>
													I have a deep apprecaition for sorrow. Its part of the spectrum of life and emotions that gets a bad rep. Interested to see how Susan Cain talks about this.</p>
